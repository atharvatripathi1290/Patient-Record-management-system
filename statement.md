# Healthcare Patient Record Management System

##  Problem Statement
Small clinics and medical practitioners often struggle to maintain patient records due to handwritten notes, misplaced files, and slow retrieval of information.  
There is no simple digital system to store basic patient details such as name, age, gender, and health problems.  
This leads to difficulty in accessing previous medical information and inefficient patient handling.

This project aims to provide a digital solution to store and retrieve patient records easily using a simple console-based application.

- Adding new patient records
- Searching patient details by name
- Viewing all stored patient records
- Validating user input to maintain data accuracy

- Individual doctors
- Medical assistants
- Students learning Java and OOP concepts


##  High-Level Features
- Add patient details (name, age, gender, problem)
